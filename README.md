## Disclaimera
- I have ZERO Knowledge about trading , but i know damn well how to implement an algorithm ...
- Please Please try it in SIM or playback and be comfortable with settings .. the strategy templates are not mine , they have been tested by some discord users.. and compiled .
- THIS IS NOT A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME .. SO DONT TREAT IT LIKE THAT.
- I WILL NOT BE RESPOSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES ðŸ˜„
- DONT BLOW UP YOUR ACCOUNT .. ðŸ˜›
- I am not a professional ninja coder.. just a self taught one so this will not be memory optimized... 16gb or higher ram may be recommended especially for ripster cloud..Also i am NOT a coder for hire.. have a 9-5 job lol .. so wont be able to do any custom coding for anyone.. this is purely Pro Bono work ðŸ˜„. Also this may have some bugs and errors, report back so that i can fix it .. ðŸ™‚. Markets always change .. so with that strategy parameters should adapt and so change settings as per market conditions.
